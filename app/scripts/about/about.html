<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>We are Julian Bracro, Brad Dymit, Jared Engler, and Alec Troemel. We are group of passionate Computer Science students from Illinois State University who are learning how to build fully-featured, industry-grade web applications as part of our class, Web Development Technologies (IT353). Our final project is to create this very web application, a million pixel project to aid Feed My Starving Childern, a Christian non-profit orginization that feeds malnourished children all over the developing world.</p>
